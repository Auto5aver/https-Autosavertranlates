        <h1 class="card-title">167</h1>
    <p class="chapter-content">"To be honest, when he said this, Duncan regretted it a bit -- he was really afraid that this straightforward girl, Vanna, would destroy her eyes on the spot. The reaction of this young judge exceeded his expectations. He had imagined that once this top villain appeared, he would definitely arouse Vanna's strong hostility, but he didn't expect her actions to be so decisive and fast. And almost in the blink of an eye, she judged the key elements of dream invasion and mirror media and carried out targeted confrontation, which is completely different from when she invaded Sherry's dream.</p>
     <p class="chapter-content">
She even tried to avoid communicating with this invader from beginning to end - this is an "emergency measure" to prevent the spread of spiritual pollution when a dream is invaded.
The fact that the gap between a trained advanced judge and a wild extraordinary person like a dog is not a little bit, if it is not Duncan's own power is too weird, and the entire invasion process is also completely based on Vanna's own mind, but if you change a little bit of invasion, I'm afraid that one face will be caught by the judge and thrown out."</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
"Now, Vanna calmed down, just quietly looking at the ghost captain appearing in the center of her field of vision - she has not yet impulsive to directly destroy her own eyes, perhaps because she has realized that this dream has been completely invaded, and ordinary exorcism methods are unlikely to work.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">She closed her eyes, and Duncan still stood in front of her, standing in the dark, just becoming more gloomy, and the shadow in the reflection of the spiritual fire appeared uncertain.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">"What do you want to do," the young judge spoke, her voice cold and hard like a piece of steel, "how did you invade my dream?"</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">Her attitude is full of hostility, but Duncan just finds it interesting - the judge's performance at this moment is completely different from her polite and peaceful appearance when she visited the antique shop.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">I don't know if one day if she knows the truth about the antique shop, what kind of reaction she will have."</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
"I'm just telling you one thing," Duncans spoke directly without wasting words, "If you really care about the safety of the city, you might as well go to the Sixth District and take a look at the small church."</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">After saying this, he closed his mouth and stood quietly in the flames, maintaining a mysterious and majestic aura.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">Vanna was stunned by the ghost captain's response.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
At this moment, it seemed as if something had pierced a curtain and revealed a corner that had always been hidden in her mind. The Sixth District, small church, these two words were strongly engraved in her mind, making her heart a moment of confusion.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
But compared to this moment of confusion, the reality of the dream being polluted by Captain Duncans touched her mind more strongly. She tried to pray to the goddess in her heart, but the goddess's power could not penetrate this layer of illusion. She looked at the "captain" in front of her with suspicion, but could not see any emotional expression from the gloomy figure.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
After a few seconds, she finally bit her teeth lightly and tried to keep calm and opened her mouth: "You invaded the dream of a judge, just for...this?"</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
"It's up to you to judge," Duncans said lightly, "I look forward to your discovery there."</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
As he said this, he began to feel that his connection with this dream was becoming increasingly unstable.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">The powerful repulsion was taking effect.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">He noticed that Vanna was not as quiet as she appeared on the surface - although on the surface she was communicating with him, every moment of this young judge relied on willpower to fight against himself as an invader, her willpower was so firm that she struggled to the point of waking up with just willpower alone!</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">

This made Duncan aware that communication must be ended quickly, after necessary information had been delivered, he should leave a mysterious image and walk away calmly.
</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
He did not intend to explain too much to the other party, and even less hope to rely on a few words to explain his friendly stance or establish any trust with Vanna - the opposing attributes of "Captain Duncan" and "City Judge" cannot be resolved by talking, too much explanation would only make him suspicious, and even divert Vanna's attention to unnecessary directions.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">

The spreading spiritual flame of darkness gradually subsided, Duncan's figure began to slowly retreat in Vanna's sight.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">But just a few seconds before the connection was disconnected, Vanna couldn't help but ask: "What do you have in mind for Plande?"</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">

Duncan raised his head in the darkness, and suddenly, a strong sense of disgust arose from his heart.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">

He stared at the young judge through the dream, and his lips slowly rose, in the green light of the spiritual flame, Vanna heard the most ridiculous and incomprehensible sentence she had heard since becoming a judge:
</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
"Order some French fries."</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
Dreamscape collapsed with a bang, connections completely interrupted.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">
In the void and chaotic darkness, Duncan stepped back slightly, staring at the flickering starlight in front of him.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">The Ai in the form of a bone dove flew over in the darkness, flapping its wings and landing on his shoulder.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">"No matter what she is going to think next, at least one thing is certain," Duncan looked at Aiyin and murmured as if talking to himself, "The Sixth District, the small church, these two key information have entered the sight of the Plande Storm Cathedral... No matter what considerations, they will definitely conduct the highest intensity investigation on that place."</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">Duncan's thinking was simple and effective- as long as he could uncover the small church in the Sixth District, as long as he could attract the attention of the Deep Sea Church, and as for what other things Vanah and the priests behind her would think, it was completely unimportant.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">The biggest moving disaster on the vast sea directly reported to the judge that there was heretical corruption in the city-state, this was enough for those priests to think about until they die, but before they die, they would definitely put all their energy on that small church- and at that time, whatever secrets were hidden in the church would be dug out by them.</p>
          <p class="chapter-content">Of course, during this investigation process, Vanah might also waste some energy due to the existence of the lost horn, but this was a minor issue.</p>
           <p class="chapter-content">Thinking of the way he had acted when the dream was about to end, Duncan's face showed a slight smile.</p>
       <p class="chapter-content">
"Fries?"  Ai on his shoulder noticed the smile and cocked its head, "Finely sliced to make sausage?"</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">
"....Your language is becoming increasingly fragmented," Duncan frowned, "But tomorrow morning, fries is good, and it's just right...</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">The heart is pounding wildly, it feels like a hot iron bar is stuffed into the head, the dull pain caused by severe depletion of spiritual power and high tension is constantly jumping between the two temples, the nightgown on the body has been wet with sweat, it is now coldly sticking to the skin, and it is particularly uncomfortable. But these uncomfortable things are nothing compared to the dream that was invaded by pollution.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">
Vanna sat up from the bed, looked around cautiously, slowly blinked her eyes, closed her eyes again and slowly opened them. Every time, her heart will pound twice - she tests whether she has really got rid of the "phantom" of the ghost captain, but she is also worried that the other party's figure will appear directly in her field of vision in the next second.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">Until she confirmed that she had got rid of the invasion and confirmed that this was the real world, she finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">As a judge for so many years, she has rarely been so tense.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">Vanna left the bed and went to the nearby dressing table</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">The dressing table is standing here undamaged, and there is only her own shadow in the mirror.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">She stood in front of the mirror for several seconds, as if to confirm every detail in the mirror, then shook her head hard, opened the drawer of the dressing table, and took out a small dagger with storm and sea wave runes.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">Holding the holy artifact, cutting the skin, letting the blood soak the runes, and then praying to the goddess of storm.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">She must tell the Archbishop Valden immediately about what happened today, along with the suspicious circumstances found in the archive hall earlier - the complexity of the situation has far exceeded expectations, and this is no longer an event that can be resolved simply by relying on the judges.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">If necessary, Prande may even have to contact the Storm Church, which is patrolling the boundless seas.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">Vanna's gaze is determined, her breath is steady, and her thoughts are clear.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">
But suddenly, a hint of hesitation crossed her mind.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">She remembered the strange scene at the end of the dream.</p>
 <p class="chapter-content">Whole Point French fries... what does it mean?!</p>
